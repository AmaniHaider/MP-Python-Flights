## Steps:
1. In this task you need to create two classes:
    - `Employee`:
        - `name`
        - `age`
        - `salary`
        - `employment_year`
        - `get_working_years()`
            - `today` - `employment_year`

    - `Manager`:
        - `name`
        - `age`
        - `salary`
        - `employment_year`
        - `bonus_percentage`
        - `get_working_years()`
            - `today` - `employement_date`
        - `get_bonus()`
            - `bonus_percentage` * `salary`
        - Where the `Manager` class inherits from the `Employee` class. 
2. Define a list of `Employee` objects for non-managerial employees, and a list of `Manager` objects for managers.
3. Print the options to the HR employee (the user).
4. If `1` was chosen, print the employees information (the employees list).
5. If `2` was chosen, print the managers information (the managers list).
6. If `3` was chosen, allow the HR employee to add a non-managerial employee to the system (the employees list).
7. If `4` was chosen, allow the HR employee to add a manager to the system (the managers list).
8. If `5` was chosen, stop the program.
9. Push your code.

Hint: The `__str__` method can help you with printing the employees information. You can read about it [here](https://www.journaldev.com/22460/python-str-repr-functions#python--str--and--repr--example)
